## Property of my pressure sensor

The resistance value of the pressure sensor varies with the change of the force on it. The more force on it, the less resistance value it has. When there is no force on it, the resistance value is infinity. If we press it, its resistance value is between 10KΩ to 30KΩ.

## How it works?

Build the circuit below. We can detect if there has a force on it by measure the voltage difference of two sides of R1.
