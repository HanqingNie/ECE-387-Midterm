# 1. What is "Whac A Mole"?

 Whac-A-Mole is a popular arcade redemption game invented in 1976 by Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering. A typical Whac-A-Mole machine consists of a large, waist-level cabinet with five holes in its top and a large, soft, black mallet. Each hole contains a single plastic mole and the machinery necessary to move it up and down. Once the game starts, the moles will begin to pop up from their holes at random. The object of the game is to force the individual moles back into their holes by hitting them directly on the head with the mallet, thereby adding to the player's score.

# 2. What is pressure sensor?

There are two basic categories of analog pressure sensors. The pressure sensor I used in this project is Force collector types. These types of electronic pressure sensors generally use a force collector (such a diaphragm, piston, bourdon tube, or bellows) to measure strain (or deflection) due to applied force over an area (pressure).
